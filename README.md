# Milan
Milan- this website is a place where help meets need. The word ‘Milan’ when literally translated from its colloquial form to English means ‘conjugation’. It is a platform where we try and bring together all the various NGOs and Clubs and potential donors across the world and connect them to the right communities so that people like you and I can send and receive help to and from our desired communities.
